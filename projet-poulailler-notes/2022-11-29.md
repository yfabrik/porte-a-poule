The Day of Week (DoW) value is user-determined. For example, if one chooses Sunday to be the first day of the week, then the DoW values would be:

1.  Sunday
2.  Monday
3.  Tuesday. and so forth.

On the other hand, if Monday were selected as the start of a week, then:

1.  Monday
2.  Tuesday
3.  Wednesday, etcetera.
